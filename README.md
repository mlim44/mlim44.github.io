## Project Introduction
The Community Support Tracker is a web application that monitors and manages community support intiatives by utilizing the following components:

### Donation Tracker
A tool that manages donations that provides a clear record contributions through user inputs and donation tracking. The record includes the amount of donation, the charity, the date of the donation, and personal messages from the donor, if included.
### Volunteer Hours Tracker
This tracker provides a record of volunteer work performed by employees by logging the number of hours each employee devotes in volunteering, the organization they volunteered for, and their experience. 
### Event Signup
A registration portal that allows the company to participate in various community events by collecting details on the expected role and event details.
